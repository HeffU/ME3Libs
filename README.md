# ME3Libs
A collection of .NET libraries to interact with the game Mass Effect 3.
This is intended to add support for modifying the game, as the original developers did not add any tools for that purpose.
All of the contained projects were created as learning exercises, and as such promise no quality and are sometimes heavily inspired from other publicly available works.

# ME3Script
WIP
Library to handle interaction with the ME3 versions of UnrealScript, intended to both decompile and compile scripts.

# Credits
ME3Explorer, all involved! (see http://me3explorer.wikia.com/wiki/About_Us)
Anton Kropp from onoffswitch.net, for a very understandable basic lexer/parser to use as starting point.
